title,review
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
A Bizarre Masterpiece,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
Not for me,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"One of the most strange films I have ever seen, and I loved it!","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
An Unconventional Mind,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"An impeccably awkward, satirical adventure into absurdity","Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Well acted, beautifully photographed, eccentric story and direction, but ultimately NOT captivating.","Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
Fiercely Original But a Bit Cold,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
Nourishing greatness!,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
LIFF37 2023 #1,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
Lanthimos at his most charming,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
Pygmalionstein...,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Love it or hate it stuff, for me, if was love, uncomfortable love.","Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
I regret watching this,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Warnings aside, just enjoy the ride!","High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
Poor Audience!,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
Very Bad,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
A GREAT film but not for everybody,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"""Poor Things"": A Cinematic Triumph of Dark Comedy and Bold Storytelling","I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time."
"Boring, flat, extremely overrated","Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
Disappointed,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout."
Brilliant,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed."
Loved the world this movie takes place in.,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it."
She grabbed my hairy business,"I gave this film a second try , I believe everyone deserves a second chance and no one a thirdThis was definitely better on the second viewing as I knew what to expect & im glad I held off before writing my review as the first time I saw it I gave it 1/10 for the first half & it wasn't until the title of my review did it change gear into dark comedy & once I knew what I was watching in first look it ended up 4/10 but its definitely better second time as I knew what to expect & what would shock me - it's the comedy that makes this filmWARNING some of the language & nudity explain why it's an 18 certificate- if you're easily offended don't watchPOSITIVES - mis en scene superb , great use of black & white to signify enlightenment & use of colour as she comes into self awarenessCinematography was superb too with the use of fish eye lens to make you feel you're in Picasso dream on Victorian steam punk opiumCostume amazing & certainly steam punk inspired , studio based location sets give you the impression you're watching a Wes Anderson film like The Grand BudapestMusic & dancing help suspend the realitySo if you put the singer bjork with all her eccentricities, Frankenstein , elephant man , dr mengele , pride & prejudice , pygmalion together then you have the rough plot.Second viewing is definitely better & it's great seeing how the female protagonist played by Emma Stone's character gets stronger & stronger whilst becoming a femme fatal breaking hearts wherever she goes , no kind hearted man or Casanova is safe once the black widow has you in her clutchesSo go see it but expect to be shocked like Saltburn shocked you - this is an avante Garde European movie that probably wouldn't have got the viewing figures had it not had Hollywood money behind it & stars such Willem Dafoe in itTwice as good on second viewing it's wonderful seeing mark rufalows character wdderburn fall from grace & wonderful seeing Bella rise as he falls with her lack of empathyThis is a great piece of cinema art - if you like arthouse cinema you'll love thisPad. A 8/10."
A truly unique movie experience,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)"
"Visually stunning, subversive, and deliciously fun","This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema."
